# delphix-go-sdk
Please, do not use this to build anything. This is experimental and only published in support of other Delphix experiments.

This is a golang sdk prototype with the object model automatically generated from the delphix.json

The object model is automatically generated by https://gitlab.delphix.com/cto-office/delphix-go-generator

Currently only generates the model. APIs are on the TODO. 

Some "level 1" functions and tests have been written (see finders and helpers)

This project will mature into a more swagger-like implementation in the near future.

There are no support, issues, or requests honored on this repository.
